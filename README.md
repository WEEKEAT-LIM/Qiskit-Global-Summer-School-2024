# Qiskit Global Summer School 2024: The Path to Utility

The Qiskit Global Summer School is a two-week intensive summer program designed to empower the quantum researchers and developers of tomorrow with the know-how to explore the world of quantum computing, as well as refresh and sharpen the industry professional’s skills. This fifth-annual summer school will prepare participants for the imminent era of quantum utility. Using hands on examples, the syllabi will guide students through areas of near-term practical importance.

# Labs

## Lab1 => Transpilation: Generating Efficient Hardware-Compliant Quantum Circuits

This lab teaches you about the transpilation of quantum circuits - a process that transforms a potentially abstractly-defined quantum computation into a quantum circuit that is compliant to a given quantum computer. Here, we will first determine properties and characteristics of quantum circuits that have an impact on the result obtained by a quantum computer. Then, we will apply Qiskit’s default transpilation to a quantum circuit before developing our own transpilation process and transpilation steps. The goal is to enable students of this lab to create their own transpilation solutions that can even beat Qiskit’s default transpilation when applied to quantum circuits with a highly specialised structure.

## Lab2 => Utility-Scale Layer Fidelity Experiment

In this lab we will show a guided construction of how to calculate the EPLG (Error Per Layered Gate) and LF (Layer Fidelity). These metrics quantify error rates in a circuit, and are particularly useful in understanding the overhead required to run error mitigation at utility-scale workloads.

## Lab3 => Quantum Error Suppression and Mitigation with Qiskit Runtime

In this lab, you will explore the error suppression and error mitigation options available with the Estimator primitive from Qiskit Runtime. You will construct a circuit and observables and submit jobs using the Estimator primitive using different combinations of error mitigation settings. Then, you will plot the results to observe the effects of the various settings.

These are the error suppression and mitigation options you will use:

- Dynamical decoupling
- Measurement error mitigation
- Gate twirling
- Zero noise extrapolation (ZNE)

## Lab4 => Simulating Nature at Utility Scale

In this lab, we will simulate the dynamics of a Heisenberg spin chain with a transverse field at a utility scale. We will explore the process of building the simulation workflow using the Qiskit Patterns framework and incorporate various error mitigation and optimization techniques to produce good results.
